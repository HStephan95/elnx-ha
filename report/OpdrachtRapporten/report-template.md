- list requirements for this iteration. Use [S.M.A.R.T.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) criteria!

- Doel: XXX
- Geschatte tijd: XXX
- Benodige tijd: XXX

## Test plan

How are you going to verify that the requirements are met? The test plan is a detailed checklist of actions to take, including the expected result for each action, in order to prove your system meets the requirements. Part of this is running the automated tests, but it is not always possible to validate *all* requirements throught these tests.

Make sure to write clean Markdown code, so your report looks good and is clearly structured on Github.

## Test report

The test report is a transcript of the execution of the test plan, with the actual results. Significant problems you encountered should also be mentioned here, as well as any solutions you found. The test report should clearly prove that you have met the requirements.
